notes
-----

- fullFORCE/FORCE comparison done
	- comparable, realistically, trying randomized trials and noise tolerance
	- fullFORCE handles noise better

- target in network works
	- both when set to t=0 and t=end of neural resp+1

- decoding w neural network works also
	- produces better traces

- questions
	- dynamical analysis portion not really working (on force or fullForce -- probably something wrong with the code)
	- possible idea: have some set of weights for each neuron rather than over the whole network
	-
